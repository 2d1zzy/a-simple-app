# The What and the Why.

This is from chapter 4 JavaScript section from the book 
Learning Web Application Deelopment. 

It required me to git init directory. Whether or not I push it to a
repo remains to be seen.

So learned a new lesson with github. Had to reset the repo since I cloned it from the web.

Created the repo "a-simple-app".
